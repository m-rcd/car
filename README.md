## Extracting classes

1. Print out the code in `/exercise/lib/car.rb`

2. Diagram the current domain

3. Annotate each line of the printout with the operations that are happening
   - describe the code in english as if to someone who is not familiar with code.

4. list all the
  - groupings of things doing similar things
  - data that is being stored in memory/changed

5. Using this information try to write a sentence explaining what exactly this class knows about.

6. Diagram a domain that demonstrates a better design

7. Out of your list choose one at a time and start to move logic out of `/lib`, test-driven.
